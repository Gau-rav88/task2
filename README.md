Data Insertion, NULL Handling, UPDATE & DELETE

      This task covers basic SQL DML operations using MySQL Workbench.
      I created tables, inserted data (including NULL values), updated rows, deleted rows, and inserted values using SELECT statements.


     Tables Created:
 
              1. students:
                  id (Primary Key)
                  name (NOT NULL)
                  email
                  age
                  
              2. courses:
                  course_id (Primary Key)
                  course_name (NOT NULL)
                  duration
                  fees     


      SQL Operations Performed:

                  Insert Data:
                          Full data insert    
                          Partial insert (NULL handling)
                          Manual NULL insertion
                          Insert using SELECT
                  
                   Update Data:
                          Update email
                          Update rows with NULL values

                   Delete Data:
                          Delete a student record
                          
                   View Data:
                          SELECT queries to verify all changes
